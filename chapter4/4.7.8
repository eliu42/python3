4.7.8 Function Annotations

Function annotations are complete optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions (see PEP 3107 and PEP 484 for more information).

Annotations are stored in the _annotations_ attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no effect on any other part of the function. Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expresion evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are defined by a literal -> followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the def statement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value annotated:
