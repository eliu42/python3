We can reate a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:
>>> def fib(n):	# write fibonacci series up to n
    """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()  # Prints a new line at the end
