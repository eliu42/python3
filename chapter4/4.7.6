4.7.6 Lambda Expressions

Small anonymous functions can be created with lambda keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: lambda a, b, a+b. Lambda functions can be uesd wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function defintion. Like nested function defintitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:

def make_incrementor(n):
	return lambda x: x + n
