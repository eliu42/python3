5.7 More on Conditions

The conditions used in while and if statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons.

The comparison operators in and not in check whether a value occurs (or does not occur) in a sequence. The operators is and is not compare whether two objets are really the same object; this only natters for mutable objects like lists. All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all numerical operators.

Comparisons can be chained. For example, a < b == c tests whether a is less than b and moreover b equals c.

Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or, and the outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean experssion) may be negated with not. These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between them, not has the highest priority and or the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (a and (not B)) or C. As Always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition.

The boolean operators and and or are so-called short-ciruit operators; their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if A and C are true but B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression C. When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.

It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example,

Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done explicitly with the walrus operator :=. this avoid a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing = in an expression when == was intended.
