5.1.4 Nested List Comprehensions

The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expresion, including another list comprehension.
Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4:

>>> matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3, 4],
	[5, 6, 7, 8],
	[9, 10, 11, 12],
]

The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:

[[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

In the real world, you should prefer built-in funcctions to complex flow statements. The zip() function would do a great job for this use case:

list(zip(*matrix))
