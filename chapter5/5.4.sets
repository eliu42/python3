Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminationg dulicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union , interseection, difference, and symmetric difference.

Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.

5.4.py is a brief demonstration

Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:
a = {x for x in "abracadabra" if x not in 'abc'}
print(a)
